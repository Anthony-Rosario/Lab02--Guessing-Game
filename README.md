# Guessing a Number Plan

## HTML layout

- make list to explain rules
- button for generating users input
- input for users answers
- span elements that hold buttons and inputs
- span element that holds feedback to users answers
- button that lets the user replay the game


## JavaScript

1. grab DOM elements

2. create functions 
    - 2 functions that display feedback to the user about his answers
    - a function to display remaining number of guesses
    - a fucntion that compares numbers
    - etc...
3. add event listeners to the buttons
    - all buttons generate on click
    - start button generates the game (displays span elements and guess count etc..)
    - the guess button compares the correct number with the users input
        * displays feedback based on users input (too high/too low/correct)
    - the reset button hides the span elements and reverts the page to its previous state before the game started.
